Pour the cold water for the rice (see ingredients for amount) into a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Stir in the rice and 1/4 tsp of salt, cover with the lid and bring to the boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to its lowest setting. Leave to cook for 10 mins, then remove the pan from the heat (still covered) and leave to the side for another 10 mins or until ready to serve (the rice will continue to cook in its own steam).\n3. Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add the sesame seeds (no oil). Cook, stirring regularly, until golden, 2–3 mins. TIP: Watch them like a hawk as they burn easily. Transfer to a small bowl but keep the pan. In another small bowl, combine the teriyaki sauce with the ginger and garlic. Squeeze the lime juice into a medium bowl and add the sugar (see ingredients for amount). Add half the toasted sesame seeds, season with salt and pepper and mix together. Add the cucumber to the bowl and mix to combine.\n4. Heat a drizzle of oil in your frying pan on a medium-high heat. When hot, add the beef mince and cook until browned, 5–6 mins. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands and equipment after handling raw mince. Use a wooden spoon to break it up as it cooks. Drain and discard any excess fat from the beef, then season with salt and pepper. IMPORTANT: The mince is cooked when no longer pink in the middle.\n5. Turn the heat down to medium, add the green beans, cover with a lid and cook for 2–3 mins. Next, add the sauce mixture with the water (see ingredients for amount) and half the spring onion. Cook uncovered until the sauce has thickened and the beans are tender, 2–3 mins. Add a splash of water if necessary.\n6. Fluff up the rice with a fork and stir in the lime zest. Divide the rice between bowls and top with the beef. Sprinkle over the remaining spring onion and sesame seeds and serve with the cucumber pickle and any remaining lime wedges for squeezing over. Enjoy!",
